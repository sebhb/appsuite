  <p>Dave,</p>
  <p>I love the datasheet in general, but I do have a few points that I think need addressing:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>I do not like the images used on the cover</li>
   <li>The opening text is really <span style="color: #aa0000;"><strong>BAD</strong></span></li>
   <li>The body text is ok, but I really think we should get a copy writer to have a go at it</li>
   <li>As for the text at the end, I really did not like it. Please have that looked at again.</li>
  </ol>
  <div>
   Apart from that it was a really good piece.
  </div>
  <div>
   Thank you for your hard work on this and I look forward to the corrections.

   Your happy lady,
